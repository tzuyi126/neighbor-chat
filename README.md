# Neighbor Chat 
A web-based communication app for neighborhoods.

## Introduction
In this project, we designed a neighborhood communication system. We designed a relational schema with an ER diagram, noted down the constraints and assumptions of our schema and justified our design with queries and some sample data. Then, we implemented a web-based application with Flask as the server, HTML and CSS as the front-end, and PostgreSQL for the database management.
